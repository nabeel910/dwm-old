My dwm setup has the following patches: 

- Rose-Pine colour scheme

- Emoji support with libxft-bgra

- fullscreen
	enter monocle mode and hides the bar

- no border
	removes border when only one window visible

- bar height
	default is 30

- switch to tag
	Adds a rule option to switch to the configured tag when a window opens, then switch back when it closes.

- focus on active

- vanitygaps (not enabled by default)

- dmenu hight priority

- alpha patch
	border opacity fix
